aq2rdb-client
=======================

The command-line, convenience client of the aq2rdb Web service.

----

The aq2rdb client is designed to map nwts2rdb style command line
arguments to aq2rdb Web service API calls, and relay any response to
stdout. It is to provide a convenient interface (particularly on
Solaris SPARC and Microsoft Windows), to ease the transition from NWIS
nwts2rdb to aq2rdb.
